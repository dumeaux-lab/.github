Our lab explores the relationship between the immune response and gut microbiome in relation to human health and disease. 

Our current endeavors focus on 
  (1) the development of computational and genomic methods to analyze microbial systems under various conditions, including drug treatments and health states, and 
  (2) the identification of tumoral, systemic, and gut microbial markers that can predict cancer therapy outcomes.
